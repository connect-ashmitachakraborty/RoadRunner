# RoadRunner
This is a simple animation project made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of this project was to practice basic web development concepts and understand how animations work in websites. It helped me learn positioning, simple keyframes, and using audio with JavaScript.HTML is used to create the structure of the page like the road, car, sky, and other elements. CSS is used to style the page and add animations such as moving the background and rotating the wheels to make the car look like it is running. JavaScript is used to control the movement and play sound when the car moves.
